# Description
The analysis uses 2021–2023 NHANES data to explore:
1. Association between BMI and systolic blood pressure (SBP)
2. BMI distributions across education levels and races
3. Variation in blood pressure across repeated measures

All plots were generated using `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and related R packages.
